    <p>I've been thinking about coding bootcamps for a long time now, ever since that one day at "Taste of code" hosted by Codaisseur! The opportunity just never really came, until now... :D!!!!!!</p>
    <p>I'm super thrilled to start, this will hopefully change my life for the better.</p>

    <p>I've have been working as a process operator for 1 year and 10 months, the job was simple and boring lots of times, but my co-workers were awesome!</p>
    <p>30th of June was my last day at that job, I resigned. The most painfull part was saying goodbye to all those good people, I'll miss them.</p>
    <p>Anyhow, before the factory work, I also did some other stuff, such as:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Marketing</li>
      <li>Waiting tables</li> 
      <li>Managing the folks waiting tables</li>
      <li>Bartending</li>
      <li>waiting some more tables</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Yea, lot's of restaurant related stuff.</p>

    <p>So, what makes me choose to do a coding bootcamp?</p>
